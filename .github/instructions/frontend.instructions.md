Use semantic HTML elements instead of generic `<div>` and `<span>` elements whenever possible. This improves accessibility and SEO.

If no semantic element is suitable for the content, think about adding a suitable ARIA role to improve accessibility.

The project aims to follow WCAG 2.2 AAA standards for accessibility. Make sure to test your components with screen readers and keyboard navigation.

Provide alt texts for images, as well as labels for inputs and icon buttons.
