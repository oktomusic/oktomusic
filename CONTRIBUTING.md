This project is primarly made as a part of my ([@AFCMS](https://github.com/AFCMS)) Computer Science formation.

As a result, I must ensure total control over the project's architecture. That's why I don't consider this project open to contributions yet.

I plan to open the project to contributions after finalizing the MVP and continue to maintain it beyond my formation.

If you still want to contribute, send me a message on Discord (@afcms), and we will discuss it first.
